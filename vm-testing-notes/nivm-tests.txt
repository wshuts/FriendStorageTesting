NavigationItemViewModelTests:
  Setup: Create VM under test
    requires initial data, dependency on IEventAggregator=>Mocked Object
  Facts: ShouldPublish, ShouldRaise

ShouldPublish:
  How?
  Action: Command.Execute
  Verify: using local event Mock, Publish with payload oneTime

  Details:
  EA is mocked
  GetEvent returns a mocked event
  Call to Publish is verified on that mocked event

  Distinction:
  At runtime -
  The "real" EA returns the "real" event
  NIVM calls Publish on the "real" event

  Commentary:
  The test is confirming: access to EA, the Publish call on correct event with correct payload & called only once

ShouldRaise
  Action: write to DisplayMember
  Verify: change notification

  Commentary: uses Extensions to confirm NPC implemented and PC event is fired using correct property name.
